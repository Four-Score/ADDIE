### Welcome to ADDIE!

### Key Features:

1. **Google Calendar Integration** üìÖ  
   ADDIE allows you to type out thoughts or upload files, and AI agents will automatically create Google Calendar events or fetch existing ones. This feature helps users stay organized by efficiently tracking all events and deadlines.

2. **Document and Email Categorization** üìÇ  
   Users can extract files from Google Drive and emails from Gmail. AI agents will summarize and categorize the content by priority (high, medium, low), helping you focus on the most important tasks.

3. **Meeting Summarization** üéôÔ∏è  
   Upload meeting recordings (e.g., from Google Meet), and ADDIE‚Äôs AI agents will generate summaries, extracting critical insights. This helps users quickly identify the key points of a meeting without getting lost in details.

4. **Task Guidance via Vector Database** üóÇÔ∏è  
   Input work-related documents into a vector database, and when starting new tasks, ADDIE provides step-by-step guidance based on the existing information. This is particularly helpful for individuals with ADHD who may struggle with focusing on the next steps in a task.
